– Lab 0: Introduction to ARM platform.
  - Introduction to ARM board (LPC1768)
  - Introduction to μVision4 software
  
    o How to create or open a project
    
    o How to build, or assemble, a target
    
    o How to download object code into memory on the target board o How to debug code
    
    o How to use the simulator
    


– Lab 1: Flashing LED.
  - Write some THUMB assembly language instructions
  - Use different memory addressing modes
  - Test and debug the code on the Keil board
  - The on-board RAM is used instead of Flash memory
  
  Flash an LED (Light Emitting Diode) at an approximate 1 Hz frequency.

– Lab 2: Subroutines and parameter passing.

  Turn one LED into a Morse code transmitter. You will cause one LED to blink in Morse code for a five character word. The LED must be turned on and off with specified time       delays   until all characters are communicated.
  
– Lab 3: Input/output interface.

  How to use peripherals (LEDs, switch) connected to a microprocessor.

– Lab 4: Interrupt handling.

  Enable an interrupt source in the LPC1768 microprocessor, and write an interrupt service routine (ISR) that is triggered when pressing the INT0 button. The ISR returns to the   main program after handling the interrupt.
